# Prime Tier 1 Week 3 - Part 3

This week, we will continue to put more into your tool belt by tackling methods for handling tasks multiple times, storing multiple pieces of information, and more advanced decision tools.

## Topics Covered

* Loops `for`, `while`, `for of`
* Arrays

## Assignment

As always, start off by forking and cloning this repository from GitHub. Open the code up in Atom to get started. 

> Note that in the future we will not call this out explicitly. We'll assume you already know that is how you start your work. 

### Reminder - Levels of Difficulty

- Required Features are required and focus on the key skills for the week
- Stretch Goals are __*optional*__!
  - These will stretch and challenge deeper understanding of the material.
  - Note that these may require additional research beyond the provided content. 

### Files Provided

- *index.html* (Note: the JS & CSS files are already sourced in)
- *style.css* (Required Feature)
- *part-supply.js* (Required Features, & Stretch Goals)

This part of the assignment will mix more of the array and loop content with more of the material from earlier weeks. Again, there are comments with instructions for completing each task.

> Please do not remove the instruction comments as you complete your work. 

There is also a small styling task in the CSS file this week. We'll build on this a little more next week, but we'll leave exploring CSS mostly in your hands as we focus on the JavaScript. 

Optionally, you may also write any remaining questions you have for the week in the HTML file.

## Assignment Submission
Check in your repo, then turn in your work via the Prime Academy Assignment Application at http://primeacademy.io, as usual and don't hesitate to hit up the Slack channel as needed!

**Make sure that you answer this week's discussion question in Slack!**
